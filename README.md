## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The major leasons I took away from this how to use css variables to aid in responsive design. 
I also learn of clamp() function in css that helped me created variable fonts.

Additional I learned how to create a responsive nav bar and use js to toggle classes.

```css
:root {
  --ff-size-heading-xl: clamp(1rem, 2vw + 0.1rem, 4rem);
  --ff-size-heading-sm: clamp(1rem, 1.5vw + 0.1rem, 3rem);
  --ff-size-body: clamp(0.7rem, 1vw + 0.1rem, 2rem);
}

```
### Continued development

I will continue to refactor and optimize the code as I continue to learn more.
